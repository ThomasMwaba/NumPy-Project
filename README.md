# NumPy-Project

This project showcases how to use Numpy for beginners by first demonstrating how to create a 1-D, 2-D and 3-D array. 
Numpy gives us the opportunity to obtain information about an array such as the dimension, shape, size and total bytes consumed by the elements in an array.

Indexing is used to access or change certain information in an array as shown in the project and also initialize certain types of arrays like identity arrays, all zeros arrays etc.

Arrays can also be added subtracted divided and multiplied, and statistical operations such as mean, max, and min can be applied to obtain the maximum, minimum and mean.
Last but not least we can do Boolean masking where we can use comparison operations to return True or False Boolean values for certain conditions as shown in the project.

NOTE: NumPy is important because it enables many mathematical functions used widely in scientific computing fast and easy to use, such as Vector-Vector multiplication
Matrix-Matrix multiplication and Matrix-Vector multiplication.
